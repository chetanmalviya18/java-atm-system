# Basic ATM System in Java

This is a simple ATM system implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The project was developed using NetBeans IDE and can be run from the terminal. This project was created as part of my learning process in Java.

## Features

- **PIN Authentication:** Ensures secure access to the ATM system.
- **Check Balance:** Allows users to check their account balance.
- **Withdraw Money:** Users can withdraw money from their account.
- **Deposit Money:** Users can deposit money into their account.
- **Menu Navigation:** Provides a simple text-based menu for user interaction.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- NetBeans IDE (optional, for development)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-project.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd atm-project
    ```
3. **Compile the Java Program:**
    ```bash
    javac -d . src/atmproject/*.java
    ```
4. **Run the Program:**
    ```bash
    java atmproject.Atmproject
    ```
    
## Learning Points

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** The ATM system is designed using classes and objects, demonstrating the core principles of OOP.
- **User Input Handling:** The program utilizes `Scanner` for reading user input from the terminal.
- **Basic Control Flow:** The application uses if-else statements and method calls to manage the flow of the program.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical example of implementing a basic ATM system in Java. It covers essential programming concepts and provides a foundation for more advanced projects. Feel free to modify and expand this project as you continue learning Java.
